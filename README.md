So uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I am part of Mother Team and Dysfunk, starting off as a low-teir fnf modder making random beats on FL Studio Mobile
now i do all kinds of [funny things](https://youtu.be/_HoHfeQNJfA), so thats cool

Yeah i do a little music, maybe a bit of coding. That's all I have to say so bye!

# Music:

There is no real way to listen to *all* my music, so here is where most of it is shared, most of them at the moment being for a project called "Friday Night Funkin': An Artist's Nightmare".
